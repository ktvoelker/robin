Use a Reader to hold the repo root

  And the semaphore?

Make our output go to a logfile in daemon mode

  And to both a logfile and stderr in debug mode

Implement watch command

  Use fsnotify to watch for changes to the status file

  When changed, grab the semaphore, print the new results, release the semaphore

Implement clean command

  This will, of course, immediately rebuild

Move all the special files into a single .cabal-dev-build subdirectory

Make it so there's only ever one daemon no matter how many projects need building
