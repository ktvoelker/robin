Stop using less

  Look at the pretty-watch branch to see if it still makes sense.

  Instead, take over the terminal directly.

  Clear the terminal and print a message when starting a new build.
  The message should have a timestamp and a serial number. Keep track of
  the serial number in a file in .robin.

Record some kind of unique build identifier in the .robin directory, and
refuse to operate if there is a mismatch.

Stop the daemon after a period of inactivity.

Run hlint

Find the repo root based on the presence of a cabal file (don't use git)

  Or a stack.yaml, or a robin.sh. Use the same precedence as the builder.

  Better yet, reuse the same information to determine how to build, to ensure
  consistency.

Write tests!

Replace uses of System.IO with conduit

Implement clean command

  This will, of course, immediately rebuild

Generate the .less file via hard-linking to .output

  Unlink .output before writing new output

Make the debug log output optional

  Or make it rotate the log

The log output would be more useful with timestamps
