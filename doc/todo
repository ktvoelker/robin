Figure out how to reduce background CPU usage

  And set a self-kill timer after an amount of inactivity

  And figure out why pkill cabal-dev-build-daemon does nothing

Figure out why only the "start" command succeeds in launching a daemon

  Probably because the others try to get the lockfile asynchronously before
  the new daemon has created it?

Run hlint

Find the repo root based on the presence of a cabal file (don't use git)

Write tests!

Control the terminal rather than relying on "clear" and "less"

  We could try to show some nifty build progress at the top

  We could also show the OK status rather than an empty page

  We could even show the project title from the cabal file!

Replace uses of System.IO with conduit

Implement clean command

  This will, of course, immediately rebuild

Generate the .less file via hard-linking to .output

  Unlink .output before writing new output

Move all the special files into a single .cabal-dev-build subdirectory

Make it so there's only ever one daemon no matter how many projects need building

Make the debug log output optional

  Or make it rotate the log

The log output would be more useful with timestamps
