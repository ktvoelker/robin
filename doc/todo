Use a Reader to hold the repo root

  And the semaphore?

Make our output go to a logfile in daemon mode

  And to both a logfile and stderr in debug mode

Implement clean command

  This will, of course, immediately rebuild

Move all the special files into a single .cabal-dev-build subdirectory

Make it so there's only ever one daemon no matter how many projects need building
