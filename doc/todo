Eliminate usage of deprecated isEmptyChan

  Instead of building when the file event channel is empty, we should build as
  soon as we get one file event with a timestamp equal to or greater than the time at
  which the previous build was started; thus, when watching, each build timestamp must
  be communicated to the watcher.

    It might be possible to simplify the code somewhat by using separate threads for
    watcher and builder, instead of synchronously alternating control between them.

Move all the special files into a single .robin subdirectory

Figure out why only the "start" command succeeds in launching a daemon

  Probably because the others try to get the lockfile asynchronously before
  the new daemon has created it?

Figure out why pkill cabal-dev-build-daemon does nothing

  Is it because the process is called robin now?

Set a self-kill timer after an amount of inactivity

Run hlint

Find the repo root based on the presence of a cabal file (don't use git)

Write tests!

Finish and integrate the pretty-watch branch

Replace uses of System.IO with conduit

Implement clean command

  This will, of course, immediately rebuild

Generate the .less file via hard-linking to .output

  Unlink .output before writing new output

Make it so there's only ever one daemon no matter how many projects need building

Make the debug log output optional

  Or make it rotate the log

The log output would be more useful with timestamps
