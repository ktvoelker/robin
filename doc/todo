Make the daemon immediate run a build when started

Implement latest command

  We need some way to know when a build is in progress

    How about we write something into the trigger file when starting a build,
    and clear it out when done?

    The build command should check the trigger file and not re-trigger if a build is
    running, instead becoming more like the latest command.

    Actually, the latest command is what we wanted the build command to be. So scrap
    the old build command and rename latest to build.

Implement watch command

Implement clean command
