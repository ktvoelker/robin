====

Finish the Console library

  Scrolling controls

  Vertical scrollbar for body

  Color

  Pages? (separated by blank lines - does this work with the compiler output?)

Control the terminal rather than relying on "clear" and "less"

  We could try to show some nifty build progress at the top

  We could also show the OK status rather than an empty page

  We could even show the project title from the cabal file!

Disable optimization for faster runs

Use new parallel option

Find the repo root based on the presence of a cabal file (don't use git)

Write tests!

Write a command that runs "cabal test"

Replace uses of System.IO with conduit

Implement clean command

  This will, of course, immediately rebuild

Generate the .less file via hard-linking to .output

  Unlink .output before writing new output

Move all the special files into a single .cabal-dev-build subdirectory

Make it so there's only ever one daemon no matter how many projects need building

Make the debug log output optional

  Or make it rotate the log

The log output would be more useful with timestamps
