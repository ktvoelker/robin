Make the build command configurable

Record some kind of unique build identifier in the .robin directory, and refuse
to operate if there is a mismatch.

Set a self-kill timer after an amount of inactivity

Run hlint

Find the repo root based on the presence of a cabal file (don't use git)

Write tests!

Finish and integrate the pretty-watch branch

Replace uses of System.IO with conduit

Implement clean command

  This will, of course, immediately rebuild

Generate the .less file via hard-linking to .output

  Unlink .output before writing new output

Make it so there's only ever one daemon no matter how many projects need building

Make the debug log output optional

  Or make it rotate the log

The log output would be more useful with timestamps
