Ideas for Tools
===============

Replayable ghci sessions?

Better ghci/vim integration?

  Interactive, like the old class project

Import management
  
  Fold imports but nothing else?

  Commands to jump around in them?

Getting documentation on Hackage / Hoogle / Hayoo

  Use the packages in the .cabal file

  Or use the imports
